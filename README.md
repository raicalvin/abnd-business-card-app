A single-screen app that displays information about a fictional business.

This is one of the first projects in the Android Basics Nanodegree program. We are tasked to create an XML layout that depicts information about a fictional business. We are required to include contact information, images, and the correct use and implementation of a LinearLayout and/or RelativeLayout.
