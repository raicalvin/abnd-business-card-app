# Android App: Business Card

## Project Information

### Synopsis

This project was created for my Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree Grow With Google Scholarship program. Our task was to create a business card app for a fictional business with at minimum one ImageView, several TextViews that show the business number, website, and address, and the appropriate layout(s) for all the views.

### Motivation

The motivation for the project was inspired by my recent trip to Japan. I wanted to create a business card for a fictional business that could assist in every aspect of traveling to Japan: flights, places to stay, things to do, attractions to see, and things to eat.

## User Interface

The UI implements an ImageView at the top, a company logo, and a scrollable field showcasing the company information. A red, black, and white color scheme was chosen for the overall design.

- Issue 1 - The ScrollView in the app does not contain a shadow element to depict to the user that the field is scrollable. This will be revised in a future update.
